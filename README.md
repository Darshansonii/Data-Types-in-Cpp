# Experiment-2

Study of Various Data Types in C++

This C++ program is designed to help beginners understand and explore the different data types available in the C++ programming language. It demonstrates how to declare variables of various types, display their values, and examine their sizes (in bytes) using the sizeof operator.

Key Concepts Covered:
Basic data types: int, float, double, char, bool

Derived and other types: wchar_t, short, long, unsigned, etc.

Memory usage: Using sizeof() to check how much memory each type consumes

Variable declaration and initialization

Formatted output using cout

Educational Purpose:

The goal of this program is to provide a hands-on introduction to how C++ handles different kinds of data, which is essential for writing efficient and error-free code.

This is typically one of the first programs introduced in C++ courses to build a strong foundation for further programming topics.

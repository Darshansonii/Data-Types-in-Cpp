# Data types in C++


Aim  
* To write and execute a C++ program that demonstrates the declaration, initialization, and usage of various data types.

Apparatus  
* Computer (Laptop/Desktop)  
* Keyboard and Mouse  
* Power Supply  

Software Used  
* Visual Studio Code  
* MinGW or GCC/G++ Compiler  
* Terminal or Command Prompt

Theory  
* C++ supports a wide variety of data types, including both primitive and user-defined types.  
* Common built-in data types include `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`, which are used to store numbers, characters, and logical values.  
* The program also utilizes `sizeof()` to display memory size allocated to each data type.  
* Type modifiers such as `short`, `long`, `unsigned`, and `signed` further refine the characteristics of the base data types.  
* Demonstrating multiple data types helps in understanding how data is stored, manipulated, and displayed.  
* It is essential for developing logic and choosing the correct data representation for different types of problems.  
* This program serves as a foundation for understanding variable declaration, initialization, and type safety in C++.
* Character data types (`char`) store single symbols and can be manipulated with their ASCII values.  
* Data type conversions (implicit and explicit) are also part of learning how variables interact in expressions.  
* Proper selection and use of data types ensure efficient and bug-free program execution.

Program Features  
* Declares and initializes variables of different types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`  
* Displays values and corresponding memory sizes using `sizeof()`  
* Demonstrates type modifiers like `unsigned int`, `long`, and `short`  
* Outputs all variable values along with their types and storage sizes

Conclusion  
* The program was successfully written and executed in Visual Studio Code using the GCC compiler.  
* It effectively demonstrated the usage of different C++ data types and how they store values in memory.  
* Understanding data types is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring proper memory usage in real-world applications.  
* This exercise laid a strong foundation for working with variables, memory, and data representation in C++.
